# valentine-card
Valentine Card I've made for my wife a while ago.
<br>
<br>
I've found part of this code in one of my old backups (like a 'dinosaur old' backups). And I decided to use that as a valentine card for my wife. So I rewrited animation part, added some css, html to make it works as a standalone website.<br> Originally heart animation was partially hidden under the black background. I decided that I like white version more - but if you really, really want it 'fade to black' (no pun intended) just change the background colour.<br><br>
Have fun!
