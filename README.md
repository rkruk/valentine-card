## üõ†Technical Details

- **Pure Vanilla JavaScript** - No dependencies
- **Canvas 2D Animation** - Hardware accelerated
- **Mathematical Heart Curve**: `x = 16sin¬≥(t), y = 13cos(t) - 5cos(2t) - 2cos(3t) - cos(4t)`
- **Particle Physics**: Attraction forces, friction, and trail effects
- **High-DPI Scaling**: Automatic device pixel ratio detection

## Story

I found part of this code in one of my old backups and decided to transform it into a Valentine's card for my wife. The original animation was partially hidden, so I rewrote the animation system, added responsive design, and optimized it for modern web standards.

## Customization

The heart size, particle count, and colors can be easily adjusted in the JavaScript configuration section. The animation maintains the same visual style while being fully optimized for performance.
